# MiniGamesForLearningUnity

This is The Project made for the sole purpose of Learning Unity Game Engine and hoping that others may stumble upon this Git and contribute by adding their own understanding To this "Challenges" or simply trying to understand the script and learn something from it.

# GAME 1 "Moving Without Restrictions"
The First 'Game'/'Challenge', Named "Moving Without Restrictions". The purpose of this game is giving the player freedom to move without any restrictions in any direction on the 3D plane. 
In addition, the camera should follow the player. Should The camera be locked or should it have some calculation logic, or should it simply be controlled by input is up to the developer, who wants to try this challenge.

PS. how you write code doesn't matter it can be with physics or without them it is up to you.


This are the games from basic physics to mini type games for the sake of making small projects everyday and learning new things.

Best Of Luck!
